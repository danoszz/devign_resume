# ðŸŒž Resume 2019 build w/ Gatsby.js

Transition to a dynamic website with the SSR Gatsby. Learning React.js, Serverless deployments and CI. Still the old portfolio, just with new content and fire elements.

## Timeline

See current progress at [issues](https://github.com/danoszz/devign_resume/issues) page.

## Get started

**Before starting**

- You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes NPM).
- Install Gulp using `npm install -g gulp`. This installs Gulp globally and is needed later.

### Local setup

```shell
git clone https://github.com/danoszz/devign_resume && cd devign_resume && npm i
```

### Run the project

Based on the [Gatsby Contentful Starter](https://github.com/contentful-userland/gatsby-contentful-starter)

- Run project locally

```shell
yarn run dev
```

- Run a production build into ./public. The result is ready to be put on any static hosting you prefer.

```shell
yarn run build
```

- Run a production build into ./public and publish the site to GitHub pages.

```shell
yarn run deploy
```
